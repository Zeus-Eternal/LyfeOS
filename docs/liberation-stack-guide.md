# The Liberation Stack: Complete n8n Implementation Guide

## Introduction

**The Liberation Stack** is a suite of personal automation workflows built on n8n. These workflows help you reclaim your time and focus by running privately on your own server with no cloud dependencies.

This document outlines how to deploy the stack using Docker Compose, configure a Telegram bot for interaction, and implement the five core workflows:

1. Daily Reflection Logger
2. Morning Truth Trigger
3. Creative Flow Tracker
4. Weekly Focus Reboot
5. Thought Vault + Serendipity Engine

All data is stored locally in DuckDB by default. Optional integrations with Notion or Airtable are also covered.

## Prerequisites

- A server or PC capable of running Docker
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A Telegram account and bot token
- Networking setup so Telegram webhooks can reach your n8n instance
- (Optional) accounts for Notion or Airtable

## Docker Compose Environment

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following configuration and copy
`.env.example` to `.env` to provide the required environment variables:

```yaml
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5678:5678"
    volumes:
      - ./n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=<your-username>
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=<your-password>
      - N8N_GENERIC_TIMEZONE=America/Detroit
      - WEBHOOK_URL=https://<your-domain>
      - VUE_APP_URL_BASE_API=https://<your-domain>
      - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<your-telegram-bot-token>
      - NOTION_API_TOKEN=<optional-notion-token>
      - AIRTABLE_API_KEY=<optional-airtable-key>
```

Start the stack with `docker-compose up -d` and log into n8n at `http://localhost:5678` using the credentials you set.

## Workflow Summaries

### Daily Reflection Logger

Prompts you each evening via Telegram to log a short reflection. Your reply is stored in DuckDB with optional sentiment analysis. Weekly summaries can be generated from the data.

### Morning Truth Trigger

Sends a random positive affirmation every morning. Affirmations can be stored in a simple list or in the database.

### Creative Flow Tracker

Automatically records creative output such as Git commits or blog posts. Generates a quarterly summary of your progress.

### Weekly Focus Reboot

Every Sunday the bot asks three questions about your goals for the coming week. Based on your answers, reminders are scheduled to keep you on track.

### Thought Vault + Serendipity Engine

Use `/vault` in Telegram to save quotes or insights. Entries are stored in DuckDB and a Markdown file. Each week one random item is resurfaced to inspire you.

## Error Handling

Set up an **Error Trigger** workflow in n8n to send Telegram notifications if any workflow fails. This keeps the system reliable and easy to maintain.

## WordPress Integration and Schema Markup

If publishing documentation or updates on WordPress, include appropriate `BlogPosting` schema in your posts. An example snippet:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BlogPosting",
  "headline": "The Liberation Stack: How I Use n8n to Automate My Life and Reclaim My Time",
  "description": "A comprehensive guide to building The Liberation Stack on n8n.",
  "author": { "@type": "Person", "name": "Zeus Eternal" },
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Agustealo",
    "logo": { "@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://agustealo.com/logo.png" }
  }
}
</script>
```

Update the URLs and dates to match your site.

## FAQ

**Do I need programming skills?** Basic familiarity with Docker and editing n8n workflows is helpful, but most steps can be copied from this guide.

**Can I use another messaging platform instead of Telegram?** Yes. n8n supports many services; replace the Telegram nodes with the platform of your choice.

**Is my data private?** All data stays on your server in DuckDB unless you choose to sync with Notion or Airtable.

## Conclusion

The Liberation Stack turns n8n into a personal automation engine for mindful living. By following this guide you can deploy a private system that logs your reflections, sends you daily affirmations, tracks your creative work, and keeps your best ideas alive.
